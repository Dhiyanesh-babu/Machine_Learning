Non parametric test:-

1.) willcoxon sign test -> compare 2 paired samples
2.) Fried man test -> compare more than 2 paired samples
3.) Mann whitney test -> compare 2 independent smaples
4) kruskal wallis test -> compare more than 2 independent smaples
5.) chi square test -> check dependency of variables (variable should be categorical)

Parametric test:-

1.) 1 sample t test -> compare sample mean with population mean
2.) Two sample paired t test -> compare mean of 2 paired samples
3.) Two sample seperate t test -> compare mean of 2 independent samples
4.) one sample F test -> Dependent variable is cont. and independent variable is categorical ( one way ANOVA )
5.) Two sample F test -> Dependent var is cont. and independent variable is categorical (2 independent var ) ( two way ANOVA )
